# Rust Implementation of Lox (Lox-Seizure)

This is my rust implementation of the Lox language from the book: Crafting Interpreters.
The first portion of the book goes on to write the interpreter in Java, as you might already know and java has been a language that I am familiar with from school but we never got very indepth with it. So I am hoping to cover all my short commings in programming in general, and also I am hoping to cover and learn Rust-lang as I go.
