# lox-seizure
This is my AST implementation of Lox from the "Crafting Interpreters" book but I am also trying to learn Rust, so hopefully I will be able to properly implement that.

Did you wonder why its called Seizure? That's because this README file might even give you one. Its going to be written in a journal format from here on out. Here we go.

### Day - 1
Just did my first ever commit with this. It's just the "Hello World". I think I understand git a little better today.
