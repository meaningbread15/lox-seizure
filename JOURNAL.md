# lox-seizure
This is my AST implementation of Lox from the "Crafting Interpreters" book but I am also trying to learn Rust, so hopefully I will be able to properly implement that.

Did you wonder why its called Seizure? That's because this README file might even give you one. Its going to be written in a journal format from here on out. Here we go.

### Day - 1
Just did my first ever commit with this. It's just the "Hello World". I think I understand git a little better today.

### Day - 2
I would like to say this is still day - 1 but I got mixed up a little in different activities like not being disciplined and other house work

So, today as of yet I have put in my Interpreter Framework doing it from jlox first of course. I still don't understand a lot of things which probably shows, but in any case I will keep going.

As to what the file does as of yet, is well.. there is no interpreter but at least if it tries its best to run a binary of a script written in lox.
